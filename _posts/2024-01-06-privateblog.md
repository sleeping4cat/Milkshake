# Making an academic Blog in minutes (minimal design)

## Introduction

In the research community, blogs are often seen as a way to demonstrate one’s ability to teach, explain, and comprehend a concept in Artificial Intelligence. This is a valuable tool for those looking for research collaborators, internships, and research opportunities.

There are several ways to create an academic blog. The traditional method is to use Medium or Substack articles. The non-traditional method is to create a personal academic blog.

The method you choose will depend on your technical ability and preferences. Traditional methods are easy to set up and require little technical knowledge. Non-traditional methods are more technical and require knowledge of certain markup languages and tools.

Of the two methods, non-traditional methods are superior in terms of control and customization. While they may be more difficult to set up, they offer greater control over all aspects of your personal blog. For this reason, non-traditional blogs are the best way to start an academic blog if you are interested in writing blogs for academic and research purposes.

4. NO monetization incentive
5. Offer Greater Readability

### Contributions
Earlier, I had cloned the blog template from https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap and modified it to create my own blog in a more minimalistic manner. I also added certain features, such as tags.
